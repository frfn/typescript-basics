# More on Interfaces

-   you can't have `#` inside an interface!

-   AnimalConstructor is an interface

# Confusing when I dealt with the AnimalConstructor interface, I still kind of am. Could not follow what he was talking about.

To understand

1. `initializeAnimal` will take 2 arguments, Animal and Name

    - `Animal` is a class
    - `name` is a string

2. `new ClassName`in AnimalConstructor will instantiate an object with that class + will return an object of type Animal

    - Animal variable is going to be the class Name

3. This is still confusing, I think I have to see it in action, examples like this just does not connect ..
