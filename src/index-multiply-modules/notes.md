# Modules

1. `import ... from ...` | `export ...`

`import { component } from '../../componenent/component/';`

if component is **not** `export` out, you can't use that variable | `undefined`!

2. I've been doing the module `export` | `import` | `default` the whole entire time... good.

3. Getting comfortable with importing | how to make an alias | created an interface with nothing inside it in `multiply.ts`
